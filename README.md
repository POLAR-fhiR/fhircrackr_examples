# A simple fhircrackr Example

This repository contains code for the example in a publication introducing the [fhircrackr](https://cran.r-project.org/package=fhircrackr) R package that has been submitted to [Applied Clinical Informatics](https://www.thieme.com/books-main/clinical-informatics/product/4433-aci-applied-clinical-informatics) recently.

The example can be run by opening the file *Example_1.R* in RStudio or an IDE of your choice and running the code line by line.
